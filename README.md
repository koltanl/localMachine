# Local Configuration Workspace

Welcome to your digital sovereignty debugging sanctuary. This repository serves as a structured workspace for agent-assisted configuration troubleshooting of your HOMESERVER setup.

## What This Is

This is your local configuration laboratory - a place where you and an AI agent can systematically work through the inevitable syntax mysteries, configuration conflicts, and "why the hell isn't this working?" moments that come with owning a professional-grade digital infrastructure stack.

## Expectations

You're here because:
- Your HOMESERVER has some custom configuration that's behaving... creatively
- You need to debug syntax, validate configs, or troubleshoot service integrations
- You want systematic, step-by-step assistance rather than guess-and-check chaos
- You understand that complexity is a feature, not a bug

## The Process

This workspace is designed for methodical configuration debugging. We'll:
- Validate syntax systematically (no more "it looks right to me" debugging)
- Test configurations incrementally 
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Navigate the specific quirks of your local environment
- Take it slow and get it right

## Agent Partnership

The AI agent in this workspace is configured to:
- Work as a systematic debugging partner, not a magic solution generator
- Understand you're modifying live configurations on your local machine
- Handle your inevitable frustration with calm, technical competence
- Ask clarifying questions when the situation gets murky
- Focus on solutions rather than apologies

## Context

This is your local Arch Linux environment. You're learning lazy vim. You've probably customized something that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM. We're here to figure it out together, step by step, with the precision your digital sovereignty deserves.

## Getting Started

Point your agent CLI at this repository to load the appropriate context and interaction guidelines. Then start debugging like the system administrator you are.

*Remember: Every configuration error is just a learning opportunity wrapped in frustration. Let's unwrap it systematically.*
